#Ev3 Showcase - local scripts

## Usage

1. Start the EV3 Device by opening the Roof of the Car and pressing the Center button. 
Now EV3 Should bootup.

2. After the device is up and running (indicatorlight is now static green and does not blink anymore) make shure it is connected to the wifi. If an IP Address is shown in the top-left corner the device is connected.

3. Navigate to Filebrowser > ev3-scripts > select proto-mqttmove.py and start it

After Calibration has finished, the car will show an infomessage on the screen that is successfully connected to the Message Broker.

To Stop the program execution simply click the Back-button on the left side under the screen.  (Not the Control-Cross-Buttons) To restart the Program follow point 3 of usage.
